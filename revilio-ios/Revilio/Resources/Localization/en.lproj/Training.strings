To exit, tap the \"CLOSE\" button in the top-right corner. If you are using the app without VoiceOver, then in each step of the training you can swipe your finger on the device screen to feel the location on the screen of the element that the current training step is dedicated to. Tutorial Part One - \"FORWARD\" Button. The \"FORWARD\" button is located on the right side of the screen, slightly below center, and takes one third of the screen width. Pressing it navigates to the next sentence of recognized text (or next line if line navigation is enabled in settings). In the tutorial, we use the FORWARD button to advance to the next section.";
"forwardDetailDescription" = "The \"FORWARD\" text fast-forward button may not work if the recognized text lacks punctuation marks that allow the application to determine the boundaries of text sentences, or if these marks were not correctly recognized due to poor text visibility, lighting conditions, and other interference. If you press the \"FORWARD\" button while reading the last sentence in the text, the device will give a tactile signal that indicates the end of the recognized text.";

The \"BACK\" button is positioned on the right side of the screen, slightly below the center, above the \"FORWARD\" button, and takes one third of the screen width. Pressing the BACK button will navigate to the beginning of the previous sentence of the recognized text, or to the previous line if line navigation mode is enabled in the app settings. After navigation, the Text Reading function will pause. To resume reading, press the \"PAUSE\" button (covered in the next tutorial section). In this tutorial, we use the \"BACK\" button to return to the previous tutorial section.";
"backDetailDescription" = "The \"BACK\" text rewind button may not work if the recognized text lacks punctuation marks that allow the application to determine the boundaries of text sentences, or if these marks were not correctly recognized due to various interference. If you press the \"BACK\" button while reading the first sentence of the text, the device will give a tactile signal that indicates that the current sentence is the beginning of the recognized text.";

"pauseTitle" = "\"PAUSE\"";
"pauseShortDescription" = "Part three - \"PAUSE\" button. The \"PAUSE\" button is located slightly above the middle of the screen, above the \"BACK\" button, and is as wide as the screen. The \"PAUSE\" button is designed to temporarily stop the execution of the main functions of the application. Press the \"PAUSE\" button, and text reading or search will be suspended, and the inscription on this button will change to \"RESUME\". Press this button again, and reading will continue from the word where it was paused, and if you were using object or text search, it will immediately resume.";
"pauseDetailDescription" = "To save device battery life and protect against overheating, it is recommended to pause the execution of \"Find Object\" and \"Find Text\" functions whenever they are not being used at the current specific moment, but will be needed a little later. By pressing the button again, you will immediately resume the search process for the object or text that was specified before pausing.";

"speedTitle" = "\"READING SPEED\"";
"speedShortDescription" = "Part four - \"READING SPEED\" button. The \"READING SPEED\" button is located slightly below the middle of the screen, to the left of the \"BACK\" button, and below the \"PAUSE\" button, and is one-third the width of the screen. Using this button, you can select the text reading speed by the speech synthesizer - normal or accelerated.";
"speedDetailDescription" = "Switching the speech synthesizer speed is available at any time during application operation and does not lead to data loss.";

"readTextTitle" = "\"READ TEXT\"";
"readTextShortDescription" = "Part five - \"READ TEXT\" button. The \"READ TEXT\" button is located slightly below the middle of the screen, below the \"SPEED\" button, to the left of the \"FORWARD\" button, and is one-third the width of the screen. The button is designed to launch the \"Read Text\" function. Point the device's camera at an object with text and press this button. You will feel tactile signals when the application begins capturing frames for text recognition. Soon after, the application will select the best frame, recognize the text on it, and begin reading it using the speech synthesizer. If the text contains punctuation marks indicating the end of a sentence, you will have the ability to navigate forward and backward through sentences. You can change the navigation method in the settings by selecting lines, the transition in this case will occur by lines of text without reference to punctuation marks. By default, \"Page\" reading mode is enabled for this function. This mode determines the text region closest to the center of the frame and allows you to exclude other text regions from recognition results - for example, if you are reading a book and part of the text from an adjacent page falls into the lens field of view. You can disable this mode in the application settings menu. You can manage shortcuts for this function in the \"Shortcuts\" app, as well as launch it using Siri. Call Siri, say \"Revilio reading\" or \"Revilio reading\", and Siri will open the app and start reading text. After the first installation of the app, Siri may not immediately recognize this command, in which case try again a little later.";
"readTextDetailDescription" = "Before using the function, make sure the device's camera lens is open and clean. For best recognition results, it is recommended to use the reading function in good lighting conditions, and also avoid moving the device and the object with text during frame capture. For reading text in poor lighting conditions, it is recommended to use the flash during frame capture; you can enable this option in the settings menu (flash is disabled by default). The minimum distance between the device and the object with text depends on the device model and should usually be at least twenty centimeters. Detection results may deteriorate if the device is positioned at an angle to the text surface. Before the application begins capturing frames for text recognition, there may be a delay until the camera's focal length and exposure stabilize, associated with changes in lighting, device position, or the position of the object with text. Loss of recognized text data will occur in the following cases: reusing the function by pressing the \"READ TEXT\" button, calling one of the other main functions of the application - object or text search, pressing the \"STOP\" button, closing the application, turning off the device. Loss of text data is possible when minimizing the application, switching between applications, as well as when locking the device screen.";

"findObjectTitle" = "\"FIND OBJECT\"";
"findObjectShortDescription" = "Part six - \"FIND OBJECT\" button. The \"FIND OBJECT\" button is located on the left side of the screen, slightly below the middle, below the \"PAUSE\" button and to the left of the \"SPEED\" button, and is one-third the width of the screen. The button launches the object search function. By default, voice input is used to specify the object for search; you can change the input method in the settings menu. Press the button, name a supported object, the application will recognize the voice, and begin searching by recognizing objects in the image from the device's camera using computer vision technology. When the searched object is detected, the application will provide the user with audio and tactile notifications about its location relative to the center of the frame. You can choose the method of object location notifications using the settings menu. The search function operation requires intensive computations that lead to significant battery drain and device heating, as well as slowing down the function, so it is recommended to completely stop or pause the search in cases where it is not actually being used at the current time. By default, the search is automatically paused after 2 minutes of operation; you can change this value in the settings menu. If you have selected object selection using a list in the settings menu, then when you press the function button, an object selection menu will appear. In the middle part of the menu is a list of objects supported by the application. In the lower part of the menu, a keyboard and input field are available; the input field is active immediately when the menu opens. Start entering the name of the object you are looking for, and the list will be filtered, leaving only those objects whose names contain a match with the entered character sequence. If you enter a character sequence that is not in the name of any of the supported objects, the application will give a tactile signal. If after entering the next character only one object remains in the list, its search will begin immediately. You can manage shortcuts for this function in the \"Shortcuts\" app, as well as launch it using Siri. Call Siri, say \"Revilio find object\", Siri will ask you to specify the object for search. Say the name of one of the supported objects, Siri will open the app and immediately start searching for it. It is recommended to use this command together with the name of the item in one phrase, for example: call Siri, say \"Revilio, find object, spoon\", and app start searching for spoon. After the first installation of the app, Siri may not immediately recognize this command, in which case try again a little later.";
"findObjectDetailDescription" = "Before using the object search function, make sure the device's camera lens is open and clean. For successful object recognition, their direct visibility is necessary, as well as sufficient lighting. In poor lighting conditions, it is possible to turn on the flashlight. The flashlight is turned on only for the time when the search function is active; this option is available in the settings menu (flashlight is disabled by default). The object search mode supports various audio and tactile notifications depending on the object's location relative to the center of the device's camera lens, allowing the user to more accurately determine the direction to the location of the searched object. If the searched object is in the left part of the screen, the user receives notifications in the form of dots. If the object is in the right part of the screen, the notifications have the form of dashes. If the object is above or below the center, the user receives notifications dot-dash and dash-dot respectively. As the searched object approaches the center, the frequency and strength of signals will increase. When the searched object is in the center of the camera lens, the tactile signal will sharply intensify and either become continuous or will be similar to stronger and longer dashes. If there are several instances of the searched object in the frame, notifications are provided for the object that is closest to the center of the frame. Detection of some objects may be difficult depending on their shape, color, location relative to the device, as well as other factors. When choosing a computer vision model for the \"Find Object\" option, the main priority was high probability of detecting small objects at distances of about two to three meters or more, which would allow the user to comfortably use the function without the need for excessive movement and approaching the device to search locations. The operation of such a model requires significant computational resources; these resources became available on mobile devices relatively recently. On older devices, the number of frames processed per second may be small, which means that the user needs to scan the space more smoothly with the device in search of the object, and also take into account that notifications about its location come with a slight delay.";

"findTextTitle" = "\"FIND TEXT\"";
"findTextShortDescription" = "Part seven - \"FIND TEXT\" button. The \"FIND TEXT\" button is located on the left side of the screen, slightly below the middle, below the \"FIND OBJECT\" button and to the left of the \"READ TEXT\" button, and is one-third the width of the screen. The button launches the text search function. By default, voice input is used to specify the text for search; you can change the input method in the settings menu. Press the button, say the word or phrase you want to find, the application will recognize the voice, and begin searching using character recognition on the image from the device's camera. When the searched word (or phrase) is detected in the device's frame, the application will provide the user with audio and tactile notifications about its location relative to the center of the frame. You can choose the method of object location notifications using the settings menu. The search function operation requires intensive computations that lead to significant battery drain and device heating, as well as slowing down the function, so it is recommended to completely stop or pause the search in cases where it is not actually being used at the current time. By default, the search is automatically paused after 2 minutes of operation; you can change this value in the settings menu. If you have selected text input using a keyboard in the settings menu, then when you press the function button, a text input menu will appear. In the middle part of the menu is a list with text search history. In the lower part of the menu, a keyboard and input field are available; the input field is active immediately when the menu opens. Enter the word or phrase you want to find in the input field, and press \"Enter\", or the \"SEARCH\" button in the upper left part of the screen, the application will start searching for the entered word or phrase. You can also press on an element in the search history list, and the search for that element will start immediately. To clear the text search history list, press the \"CLEAR HISTORY\" button located above the list, you can also clear history using the button in the settings menu. You can manage shortcuts to this feature in the Shortcuts app, and you can also launch it using Siri. Call Siri, say \"Revilio find text\", Siri will prompt you to enter the text you want to search for. Say the text you want to search for, Siri will open the app and immediately start searching for it. After you first install the app, Siri may not recognize this command right away, in which case try again later. Siri may not always recognize the text you enter as searchable, for example, if you say a three-digit number, a short abbreviation, and in some other cases. If Siri does not recognize the word or phrase you say as searchable text, use one of the text input methods provided by the app.";

The flashlight is turned on only for the time when the search function is active; this option is available in the settings menu (flashlight is disabled by default). The text search mode supports audio and tactile notifications similar to object search mode notifications; you can learn more about them from the previous tutorial step \"Find Object\" by pressing the \"MORE DETAILS\" button in it. Text detection may be difficult depending on lighting, frame blur, font size and type, inscription contrast, as well as other factors. For best results, avoid sharp movements and shaking of the device, and also take into account that notifications about the location of detected text come with a delay. When the \"Find Text\" function is running, the processing time for each frame depends on the total amount of text in the frame, which is why scenes with a large volume of text can cause a more noticeable delay in processing and transmitting notifications.";

"stopTitle" = "\"STOP\"";
"stopShortDescription" = "Part eight - \"STOP\" button. The \"STOP\" button is located at the bottom of the screen, below the find object, read text and forward buttons, and is as wide as the screen. The button completely stops the currently executing function, and also resets the camera zoom to position one";
"stopDetailDescription" = "When you press the \"STOP\" button, the application immediately interrupts the execution of the read text, find object, or find text function if one of them was active. It is recommended to press the \"STOP\" button immediately after completing the use of application functions, especially search functions, as their execution leads to rapid battery drain, as well as heating and slowing down the device's performance. When you press this button, data obtained during the operation of functions is lost, for example, recognized text or the type of object that was specified for search. If text search was performed, then after pressing the \"STOP\" button, the searched text is saved in the input history. If during the operation of any application function you need to restart this function, or start another function, then pressing the \"STOP\" button is not required.";
